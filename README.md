# FidMe Ruby challenge

This small exercice is just meant to challenge new FidMe appliants.

### Get started !

- Clone this repo (do **not** fork it)
- Install ruby if you haven't (any version will do fine)
- Run `ruby main.rb --loyalty_card_id=1 --user_id=5`

### The challenge

We are building a **wallet app**. Let's call it FidMe !

Our wallet app is made of a few identities: 
For now we have users and loyalty cards.

Users can own loyalty cards.
Users can gain rewards (points) for a given card.

We already have a few data at our diposal (see `input.json`) and a main program (see `main.rb`)

The problem is... the command `ruby main.rb --loyalty_card_id=1 --user_id=5` always returns the same value !! 

Write code that reproduces the output of the command, but is actually working with `input.json` data.

### What we expect from you

- Take your time :)
- Produce what your consider to be clean code. 
- Use object oriented programming
- Do not try to overthink it
- Use any library or tool that you want (except Rails ;) ). 
- You can create files and folders if you want
- You can (and we would love if you do) write test (but it is ok if you are not confident with it).
